# runpod-serverless-comfyui-worker
A somewhat optimized, serverless [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) worker for [RunPod](https://www.runpod.io/), highly specific to my own personal use case, which just happens to require a lot of customization and flexibility! :heart:


## Features 
* Launch [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) workflows on demand in seconds
* Automatically upload generations to Amazon AWS *(requires [ENV Variables](/readme/aws-setup.md))
* Get base64 data for generated images as job output *(when not aws upload && tobase64 flag set)
* Image based on [Ubuntu + NVIDIA CUDA](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda)
* Easily add custom models/loras/nodes/etc via a selection of methods
* Sends progress updates so you can track/display them in your own ui
* Support for runpod network volume mounted models/nodes
* Allows for batch image processing && bulk AWS uploads
* Job output also returns non image/video node outputs
