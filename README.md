# runpod-comfyui-worker
A somewhat optimized, serverless [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) worker for [RunPod](https://www.runpod.io/), highly specific to my own personal use case, which just happens to require a lot of customization and flexibility! :heart:


## Features 
* Launch [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) workflows on demand in seconds
* Automatically upload generations to Amazon AWS *(requires [ENV Variables](/readme/aws-setup.md))
* Image based on [Ubuntu + NVIDIA CUDA](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda)
* Sends progress updates so you can track/display them in your own ui
* Easily add custom models/loras/nodes/etc via a selection of methods
* Returning base64 data for generated images *(when not aws && tobase64 flag set)
* Allows for batch image processing && bulk AWS uploads
* Job output also returns non image/video node outputs 


## Default models/nodes for dekita/runpod-comfyui-worker:latest
