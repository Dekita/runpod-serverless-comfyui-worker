## How to get the workflow from ComfyUI?

* Open ComfyUI in the browser
* Open the `Settings` (gear icon in the top right of the menu)
* In the dialog that appears configure:
  * `Enable Dev mode Options`: enable
  * Close the `Settings`
* In the menu, click on the `Save (API Format)` button, which will download a file named `workflow_api.json`

You can now take the content of this file and put it into your `prompt` when interacting with the API.
